This paper investigates time-varying convex optimization problems (TVCOPs). We propose a fixed-time convergent fast neurodynamic approach (FxFNA), which avoids
inverting the Hessian matrices of TVCOPs and possesses lower computational complexity. Moreover, it is proved that FxFNA
exhibits fixed-time convergence characteristic, whose settling
time is bounded by a constant that is independent on the
initial states. Furthermore, for the first time we provide the
necessary and sufficient condition such that the class of inverse-
free neurodynamic approaches to avoid singularity when the
error function tends to zero. Simulation results conducted on
a target tracking problem validate above conclusions.
